# Introduction to Databricks

Discover how the Databricks Lakehouse platform modernizes data architecture using the new Lakehouse paradigm. Explore the foundational components of Databricks and their integration. Engage with the Databricks UI, platform architecture, and workspace administration. At the same time, practical exercises guide you through SQL queries, platform features, and external system connections, introducing you to the efficient data management and seamless integration Databricks can offer.

# Databricks Architecture

In Databricks, the control plane and compute plane are distinct layers responsible for different aspects of the platform's operation:

- **Control Plane**: This is the management and orchestration layer. It handles user authentication, cluster management (starting, stopping, scaling), workspace administration, metadata management, and overall platform operations. Think of it as the "brains" of the operation. It's responsible for coordinating and monitoring the compute resources.

- **Compute Plane**: This is where the actual data processing happens. It consists of the worker nodes that execute Spark jobs and other computations. These are the clusters you create to run your code. The compute plane is responsible for the heavy lifting of data processing and analysis. Think of it as the "muscles" doing the work.

In short: The control plane manages the resources, while the compute plane uses those resources to perform computations. They work together seamlessly to provide the Databricks service.
